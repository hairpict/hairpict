<p>Hogwarts mystery is the first game in which players can create their own character and experience life as a hogwarts student. Hogwarts mystery fans were able to take a look at the magical creatures reserve before jam city removed it from the game. This quiz will be set like a story in the magical world of harry potter, created by j.k. Hagrid introduces the magical creatures reserve and the niffler. Doing so will earn experience for the magizoology skill and award bonuses for your game like energy, diamonds or coins. Pin by Blake Hawkes on Wizarding World Harry potter.</p>
