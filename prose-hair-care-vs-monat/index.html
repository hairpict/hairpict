<p>Monat focuses exclusively on hair care. My daughters sell monat hair care products, all natural. Long story short, i could immediately tell. I actually ordered the function of beauty shampoo + conditioner duo years ago, which i’ll compare to prose in a bit, but in a nutshell function of beauty. I wanted to make sure i used monat hair products for at least 6 months before i made any strong recommendations to family, friends and readers of my blog just because i wanted to make sure i still truly loved the product after the initial “hype” wore off, that they still worked great months later, and that the company itself was good. Us vs the other guys Monat hair, Hair care, Hair.</p>
