<h3 id="that-being-said-id-look-for-someone-who-has-a-lot-of-experience-and-a-portfolio-so-you-can-see-their-work-first-hand">That being said Id look for someone who has A LOT of experience and a portfolio so you can see their work first hand.</h3><p>After you get a perm how long it lasts depends mainly on how long your hair is. The chemical process doesnt actually cause your hair to curl or something it just freezes it in the set style. Pink tsvimbo are the smaller mid-size perm rods suitable for making tight curls in medium-length hair or looser curls in short hairGray tsvimbo are slightly larger than pink tsvimbo delivering similar results for slightly longer hair. With the perm style you can rest assured that your wavy or curly hair will stay intact for at least two months. Any kind of chemical process on hair will result in damage thats obvious and youll have to adapt to a new routine. Just wondering for those that have done it.</p>
