The slight moisture and your body heat create a green house effect helping to keep your curls moist so you can simply fluff and go come morning. Especially if your hair tends to dry out overnight a scarf or bonnet will protect your hair just like a satinsilk pillowcase but it has the added benefit of holding your hair in place throughout the night and trapping moisture. For wavy hair apply a style-setter or mousse and twist hair into a top knot bun. Use hair oil purchased from a drugstore or mineral or olive oil. Pin On Hiusunelmia Hair Dreams.</p>
