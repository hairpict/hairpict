<p>How do they stay so slim. They are pretty much put on a super-strict diet and are pushed to keep fit especially since they have to sing and dance at the same time and trust me its really hard. For example Hyuna who looks voluptuous on TV is really skinny. Taemins still a bit too skinny 5lbs under. Because when they are on screen they will look chubby than in real life so idols often have to squeeze their weight so that they are as thin. Pin On Bikini Body.</p>

<p>Lin Nov 2 2020 6234 Views. According to professional photographers you can easily add 10 pounds to yourself in a photo in order to look slim and gorgeous in photoshoot and CF there are many KPop idols who work extremely hard to stay slim a high percentage of them. Hopefully as she gets older she has learned the lesson and fans can forgive her. With so much pressure to be the skinniest that they can be our K-Pop idols do all that they can to get those chopstick legs. Thats probably the reason why Nancy becomes one of the most hated Kpop idols. Pin On Kpop.</p>
