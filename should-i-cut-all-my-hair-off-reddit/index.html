While cutting everything off is certainly the quickest way to grow a healthy head of hair it can be a long journey to get back to the length youre looking for. I have been going to this stylist for a year and a half and for some reason he decides to cut my hair off. Pin On Hair.</p>

<p>This time I cut off 14 inches. I have decently long hair a couple inches under my boobs and Im thinking about cutting it to just under my shoulder but Im not sure if I should do it or not please help me decide I would be cutting off about 7-8 inches. Theres no look under the sun that Charlize Theron cant pull off including. I cut it and I love it so much. I really want my hair long or I like to keep it short are commonly heard phrases from clients. Pin On Bob 2020.</p>
