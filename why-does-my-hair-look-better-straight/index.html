<p>In order to get to the bottom of my hair curling problems I met up with Morgan Roy creative director at the Aveda Institute Toronto. This means that if the hairdresser ends up removing to much weight from thin hair it may end up looking straggly or wispy. I straightened my hair back in high school every day too and I got compliments so thats why I kept it up. College life now I dont have the time nor care what people think of my wavy hair.

<p>There could be other options but those two are the most common ones. But I do know what yall mean.
