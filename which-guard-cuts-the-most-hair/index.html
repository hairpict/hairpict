The clipper houses Wahls V5000 electromagnetic motor which stands up to even the toughest of hairs. The 1 guard is still ideal for buzz cuts or you can use it to taper or fade from different numbers. If you like your hair to be nice clean and short but want to still have a tiny bit of length I often recommend going with this number. Pin On Hair Cutting.</p>

<p>Basically if you are looking for a stunning fade or buzz cut guard comb 1 2 and 3 are always your best bet. The Burr Military Haircut. Most clipper guards which attach to your clipper blades run from length 12 or 1 to length 10 or greater. The entire haircut done with clippers. This will allow your hairdresser to see your various curl patterns and give you a long layered haircut that enhances your curls and waves the most.

<p>A length 12 or 1 guard will cut your hair very close to the scalp while a guard with a higher number will leave your hair longer. After taking a shotgun blast to the torso the casino guard in question dropped to his knees then swayed back and forth for several seconds before finally toppling over in a dramatic display fit for stage acting. As with most buzz-cut variations it looks great tapered down to nothing at the nape of the neck. I prefer my hair shorter. I get it to about 12 finger-length on top and either a 1 or no guard on the sides and back faded high. Pin On Shaved Heads.</p>
