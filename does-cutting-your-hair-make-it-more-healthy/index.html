If hair is already healthy and remains healthy cutting it will not make you hair healthier. This way your hair can continue to grow healthily from your roots but the ends wont fray and snap shorter. Essentially when you cut your hair you get rid of the dead ends and this makes your hair appear a lot stronger and healthier. Pin On Spoke Weal Press.</p>

<p>Hence trims can help your hair to grow longer. But pubic hair was put there to protect your genitalia from friction and infection. Anything that is going to put stress on the hair is going to weaken the strand making it more likely to break before longer lengths are reached So. Healthy hair might not grow faster per say but itll definitely grow nicer which gives the illusion of speed. Getting regular trims will freshen your hair and let you start replacing damaged locks with healthy new ones. Pin On Hair.</p>
