<p>On fill slopes cutting length can vary from 20 to 50 meters. If such slopes are not cemented then vibration would easily disturb their stability. A slope is an inclined boundary surface between air and the body of an earthwork such as highways cut or fill railway cut or fill earth dams levees and river training work. Vertical cut slopes should not be used unless the cut is in rock or very well cemented soil.
