<p>Over the years Ive learned what works best. Many women and men with long hair often age themselves unnecessarily by allowing their hair to fall too flat on their face either by combing it down too much or not using mousse or similar when blow-drying Even explains that. Turns out Ive been blowdrying my hair all wrongand not only does it not look as good as it could but Ive been damaging it. You can fix this by getting some layers cut in which case youre sacrificing the volume at bottom to gain more volume on top. Also if I dont straighten my hair Ill tie it up because my hair looks stupid when its down but not straightened. Pin Pa Hair.</p>
