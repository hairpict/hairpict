<p>It used to be dark thick and curly. 48 votes 27 comments. Should I cut all my damaged hair off. Ive had long hair nearly my entire life and I love it about 3 12 years ago though a hair dresser cut off around 2 feet of hair all the way up to bsl after this cut I started straightening my hair every day because if I didnt it barely fell to shoulder lengthmy hair is naturally curly. My severely heat damaged hair didnt break off most of the curls came back with the treatments some didnt and I had to cut those straightwavy ends. Pin On Little Look Of My Work.</p>
