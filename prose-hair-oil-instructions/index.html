Darshana�s luxurious hair oil smells like orange and transforms thirsty, dull strands. A premium oil that protects strands and smooths away frizz. However, you can also massage a hair oil like sachajuan�s intensive hair oil ($33) into your strands before shampooing and conditioning, in order to speed up the removal process.
