<p>Determining your face shape depends on 3 things your forehead cheekbones and jawline. That and I cant stand having hair on my face drives me crazy not being able to tie it back haha. As a general rule you should want a hair cut to even out your face. The curtain fringe suits more face shapes and features than other fringe styles because it can be tweaked so many ways. With the style and layers that are rightly fit for your face you can add more definition to your appearance.

<p>Avoid a thinned out fringe if your hair is too fine at the risk of not having enough substance. I love the shorter fringes like these. When it comes to choosing the right fringe its imperative that you not only have a fabulous hairstylist but you have an understanding of which fringe and hairstyle will suit the shape of your face.

<p>The picture is me I want it really choppy layered and razor cut with a full fringe which is layered and razor cut when I was little I used to have a full fringe and my appearance hasnt changed but I dont know if it would still suit. Think twice if your hair is nowhere near thick because to create bangs with thin hair you start cutting hair from the center-top of your head and it might turn out in the process that you have not enough hair to get the bangs you. That and I cant stand having hair on my face drives me crazy not being able to tie it back haha. Equally avoid short fringes with curly hair. A heart shaped face needs a fringe that will soften the long prominent chin so you need a blunt heavier sharp fringe to make the face appear more in proportion.
