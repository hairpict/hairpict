<p>Well if you have straight hair i reckon you would look really good with a front fringe. A long and straight fringe that stops just above your eyes will work to shorten the length of your face. The idea to push them to one side was a good one but unlike Kirsten Dunsts bangs theyre not long enough yetso they just fall into her eyes and make her face look wider. Try to avoid micro fringes as they may pull your face downwards. A long eyebrow length fringe will perfectly match your strong jawline. Pin On Hair Cut.</p>

<p>If you were to diagnose me. Try to avoid micro fringes as they may pull your face downwards. Well if you have straight hair i reckon you would look really good with a front fringe. To make it look like you have an oval face or long face shape keep the sides flatter to help elongate the face. But if you want something different try a layered fringe.
