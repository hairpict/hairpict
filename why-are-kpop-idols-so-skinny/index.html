<p>What do they eat. 06012021 Kpop idols are skinny because of the tight schedules they follow while also dieting and working out. 31102021 well at least i found a real gf to do it with instead of spending 16 hours a day fantasising about kpop idols like i did in the past. And too often youll find opinions like that of ethan klein a 12 k pop idols. Yoona SNSD Although always. Pin On Nayoung.</p>

<p>They are very strict on what they eat and live very active lifestyles that promote a slim figure and small features. So thats all I have to say about why K-POP idols are so skinny. Honeslty I think its just stupid that companies do this. Which is so stupid there are several ex female idols and trainees who talked about the toxic body standards in kpop. For the weight Im not sure never saw anything too crazy. Pin On Belleza.</p>
