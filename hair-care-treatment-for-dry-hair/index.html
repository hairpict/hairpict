<p>The indian gooseberry amla extract nourishes the scalp and stimulates hair growth. when i first used this on my dry hair, the heavenly jasmine scent alone was enough to sell me on it. Mix 3 to 4 tablespoons of aloe vera gel with 11/2 tablespoons of coconut oil. Work the mask through dry hair from roots to tips (if your hair�s oily, skip your scalp). It may result from hair care habits or a health condition. Make a thick, smooth paste with baking soda and water and comb it through your hair, followed by a thorough rinse and wash. No more dry hair. Natural treatment for split ends.</p>
