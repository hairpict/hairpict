<p>Answer 1 of 7. Trimming in a goatee or growing the beard longer on your chin will have the opposite effect of making your head appear more oval. And the right beard style can actually make your face look thinner. This is one of those beard styles for the fat face which require a lot of care before as well as after the growth of the beard. Now I have seen big guys grow in their beards and when they keep them short and cropped then I think that actually adds width to their faces and makes them look even wider which is not good.

Trimming in a goatee or growing the beard longer on your chin will have the opposite effect of making your head appear more oval. Conversely if the garment is diametrically opposite in its descriptors from the terms that might describe you you are likely to exaggerate the differences in a negative way as well.
