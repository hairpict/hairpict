This speed and convenience is what allows most barbers to charge less for a haircut than most salon stylists who use scissors. I should note that I was using a 10 blade under the clipper combs rather than the 30 blade which is more recommended for use with clipper combs. If you like your hair to be nice clean and short but want to still have a tiny bit of length I often recommend going with this number. Next we used just the blade a 5FC that cuts down to 14-inch. If you want to imagine the size of the haircut recall the length of a beard of two or three days.</p>
