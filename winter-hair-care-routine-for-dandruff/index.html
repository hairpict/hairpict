<p>Winter dries out the moisture from your hair, and it becomes prone to dilemmas, including an increase in dandruff, breakage, split ends, and dryness. Wash your hair less often to keep your scalp’s natural oils intact. This may lead to dandruff, scalp irritation, and flakiness, causing hair fall. Dry scalp and dandruff are typical winter issues and so is frizz. This is my personal hair care routine which i am currently following and i am very happy with the results. hair haircare haircaretips hairfall remedy remedies.</p>
