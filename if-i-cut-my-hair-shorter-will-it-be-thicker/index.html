<p>If your tresses need a bit of love your hairdresser can help work out a style that will work best for you. Yes it is thick and healthy than the damaged hair but it does not help to grow hair in the bald spots. Hair typically has more body when its shorter thus giving the appearance of thicker hair. If the hair is texturized too much or given too many layers this will cause the hair to look even thinner. Choppy layers can make your hair look thicker than it really is and styling it with some texturizing paste will give your hair an extra bit of edge. 60 Gorgeous Long Pixie Hairstyles Longer Pixie Haircut Thick Hair Styles Long Pixie Hairstyles.</p>

<p>You really dont need to cut it to shoulder. I cant believe i actually did it. For me I have thinish stick-straight hair that can never hold a curl or style at all. If I cut my hair shorter will it make it curlier. If you have a very short haircut trimming will maintain the style without looking much different at all. Pin On Hair Styles.</p>
