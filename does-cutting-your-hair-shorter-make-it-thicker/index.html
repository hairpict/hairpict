That way you avoid split ends not only because you cut them off but also because hair ends that are shoulder-length or longer break more easily. It may appear thicker but thats only because the fine ends of the hair have been removed. This way your hair can continue to grow healthily from your roots but the ends wont fray and snap shorter.
