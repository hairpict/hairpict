<p>Fringe Recommendations Since your face is long and you have a deep forehead any type of fringe will look good on you. This will help balance the shape of your face without bringing too much attention to your jawline. Not all fringes are created equal but when you find that fringe that fits your face perfectly it has the power to take on its own personality and bring something out in you that you didnt even know you were hiding. For people with a round face a fairly long layered side fringe works best. Drag your hair up over the top of your head so it falls to the front of your face.
