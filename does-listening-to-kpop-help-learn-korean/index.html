<p>What is Kpop in Korean. I only formally began studying Korean last semester. If a song is played a lot people will know it but the only big kpop fans I know are the teenagers I teach and even then it is the girls. Many k-pop fans want to learn Korean to sing their favorite songs which can be especially awesome for audience participation at live concerts said Oh. Focus on the music. Pin On Kpop Fans Unite.</p>
