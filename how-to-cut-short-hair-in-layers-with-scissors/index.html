<p>Spiky Short Razor Cut Hairstyle. Between the outgrown layers split ends and awkward bang lengths theres no denying that lockdown has seen its fair share of bad hair days. Thinning shears cut sections of your hair shorter so getting too close to the scalp or hair line can also be extremely problematic. The shorter hairs may start to lift off the head similar to when a cowlick is cut too short and it stands on end like Alfalfa Small explains. Divide your hair into four equal sections two in the front and two at the back. Pin On Cute Ideas Diy.</p>
