<p>A pixie cut is a short womens haircut with short layers at the back and the sides and a longer section at the top. It may vary from above the ears to below the chin. Twist the hair tightly and choose where you would like the layers to fall against your face. Look how beautiful it looks. Allow the hair to fall on your face and brush it a few times.
