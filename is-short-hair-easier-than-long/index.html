<p>Now since each piece is smaller I can style my hair in 15 minutes so I can get some extra sleep. Short hair makes other people think you have good bones determination and an agenda and the way Buck sees it your face is no longer a flatscreen surrounded by a curtain. You can easily wash long hair once a week or once every 2 weeks. You can get long hair up off your neck into a bun held by only 1 hairstick in under a minute. For this reason many women cut their hair short to save time and the effort of maintaining it. Pin On Easy Hairstyles.</p>
