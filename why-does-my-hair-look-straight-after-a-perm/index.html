<p>In my experience with perms if youve wound it well with small sections left the lotion on until you get a good s shape forming and rinsed and neutralised well you cant make that hair straight again unless you use chemicals. If your clients hair isnt dry then the chemicals and heat can easily burn it. When you go in for a perm your hair stylist will put your hair into curlers and apply a chemical that breaks down the keratin in your hair. The bonds in the hair have been broken and then reformed in the curled shape - its permanent. Thats because the chemicals will still reach the hair cuticles during treatment. Pin On My Style.</p>

<p>Another myth is that you should not use the hairdryer to dry your hair for a. Balancing the moisture of your clients hair can have a huge effect on the outcome of their perm. Your use of the deep conditioner was a step in the right direction. Because it is a perm you face the same after-effects associated with perming. With perms you are damaging the cuticle of the hair with chemicals and heat and if the damage is irreversible the curl wont hold its shape.

<p>For this reason hair may be either curled or straightened during the time the perm solution saturates the strands. You also dont want their hair to be too oily. Sometimes when the hair is damaged the perm will not take. Some sections of hair may be much coarser than the rest or a texture more difficult to perm resulting in the need to have that area exposed to the chemical treatment longer. Thats because the chemicals will still reach the hair cuticles during treatment. Pin By Taylor Wilson On With The Good Hair Wave Perm Beach Wave Perm Permed Hairstyles.</p>

<p>That said the straight perm is in essence damaging to the hair strand. If your clients hair isnt dry then the chemicals and heat can easily burn it. But after 40 my hair didnt look good straight because of thinning so I decided to get my hair super healthy and perm it.

For this reason hair may be either curled or straightened during the time the perm solution saturates the strands.
