<p>If you want something on the shorter side opt for an asymmetrical tousled bob. Different bangs suit different face shapes. Just like a heart that you would draw out a heart-shaped face is wider at the hairline and temples and tapers to a small narrow chin that is slightly pointed. Blunt bangs and long.

<p>If you are not sure you have a heart-shaped face take a look at her and check out if the forms are similar. Daily styling of bangs may or may not be needed depending on your hairline and hair texture. However it is particularly flattering on those with heart-shaped faces as it has a balancing effect that draws attention down and towards the eyes. And I should probably note that side bangs really soften up square or rectangular faces and are generally flattering on most people. Swopping side bangs will add more face-framing and look great with glasses. Pin On Frisuren.</p>

<p>This hairstyle is perfect for women with round faces or for those that need to wear glasses. So thats exactly what we did. A sleek bob and these bangs give your face a heart-shaped look nobody can resist. For reference she says we should look to celebs like Megan Fox Halle Berry and Anna Kendrick.
