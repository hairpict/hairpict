<p>This can easily be done by twisting a curl and snipping off a small amount at a time. Curly hair can hide a bad haircut as long as the layers are relatively even. Some meanwhile criticized barbers who fight the texture of your hair. I am used to stylists layering my hair by taking a chunk of it and holding it straight out from my head and then cutting it in a straight line - I think this makes it look more natural. The twists will come undone but some of the ends will remain stuck together slightly enhancing your choppy look. Pin On Haircuts.</p>
