<p>We recommend that the hair be cut after the treatment, as the hair will have a smoother texture and will lie differently. Your hair will lose the glossy shine unpredictable: Keratin treatment after color protects hair color from fading. So if you wish to avoid that, then moisturizing your hair after the treatment is absolutely necessary. This professional studio treatment is followed by an amazing line of products that come with reasonable price tags. Before &amp; After Keratin Treatments G Gï¿½s House of Beauty.</p>
