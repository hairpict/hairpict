I�ve been using prose for 2 months now and i don�t really have anything very negative to say about this shampoo and conditioner, but i don�t really have any positive to say either. I love the way my hair looks but hate the way it feels when i use dry shampoo in general. Not stuff or powdery like the other stuff. Personalized hair care is hot right now! I have been.</p>

<p>However, the past 2 times i’ve used it, a handful of hair fell out in the shower. I have been using prose for 5 shampoos now and done two masks: It�s at the core of prose�s custom hair care ($53) system, and the reason why i have silky soft, bouncy, mermaid waves right now. Prose is custom made shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask. I reviewed the personalized prose shampoo a while back, and now i’m ready to share my experience with a third custom hair care brand: Prose Personalized Haircare Review Hair care routine.</p>
