<p>Your hair should be straight in first 3 days. Nowadays, all wish to have straight hair and there are hair straightening methods used to do if the hair is not. Stay clear from hot water as it will rip off moisture from your hair. Wash hair less frequently (only with cold or lukewarm water) and instead of dry shampoos use talcum powder if your roots get oily as dry shampoo will lead to build up if used too much. If using a shampoo use a mild one for dry and damaged hair. Incredible before and after results from Zelo�s Home.</p>
