<p>Like since Ateez is touringworld. However keep in mind that the idols that came from overseas came with a reason. I was intrigued by that 9muses member confession who said that her and the members of her group had just enough money to pay food. Most idols train for upwards of two years. Ofc I dont ask this question for groups like Big Bang SNSD Super Junior or TVXQ.

<p>She was paid about 560000 USD per a commercial film and she earned over 95 million USD in a year. I am wondering how much rest a group or idol would usually get. A typical Kpop Group is 6 membersso they will split 10 amongst themselves. So lets say an event brings in 1 million. That leaves around 16000 per member. You As Kpop Idol Idol Kpop Idol Kpop.</p>

Plus the jacket shooting for the mv you know the concept photos and all would be. Thats if we only count the groups that make it in the first place which is a small fraction.

<p>YouTube star and former K-pop idol Grazy Grace uploaded her video This Is How Much I Made As a Kpop Artist In 3 Years revealing that during her three years as a K-pop idol she earned 0 from the music itself and less than US500 S67488 in total for other activities. The growth of K-Pop has doubled over the decades which makes everyone ask. A look at the highest-earning members of the boy band. Ofc I dont ask this question for groups like Big Bang SNSD Super Junior or TVXQ.
