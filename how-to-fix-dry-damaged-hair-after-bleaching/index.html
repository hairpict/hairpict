<p>Jadedangel from New Mexico. This is what my hair looked like using JUST 20 developer plus T18 toner. Hop in the shower and shampoo your hair as you normally would. Well those blonde locks may develop brassy tones after bleaching if you have a buildup of chemicals or minerals in your hair. Use a clean soft microfiber cloth. Pin On How To Repair Damaged Hair.</p>

<p>If foils are placed too close it could leave whats called a bleed or a spot of bleach thats leaked onto the hair beneath the foil and that can be difficult to fix. I literally used up the whole tub and saw no difference. Hair exposed to sun and chlorine and some hair products. Cant wait to try out other colors. I put it on my dry hair and left it on for about 30 minutes and my hair turned out purple and washed out after some washes.
