<p>But if you do they should be as LONG as possible. With fine hair especially if the hair has thin density the decision to add layers to build volume depends on whether or not there is any curl or wave to the hair and how much. Layering removes the extra bulk in your hair and enhances hair volume and movement. Choppy Bob Light layers with waves add ruffled volume to fine hair. If you want to have a smart and stylish look then you are required to adopt the right haircut with respect to the nature of your hair. Pin On Hair.</p>

<p>Finally unlike bobs and layers these cuts can by all means be combined especially on long thick hair which will be thinned out and given movement. When I have a client with thin hair I would normally suggest a blunt cut with layers. Long layers create more texture and movement in your hair helping to take the focus away from thinning. Layers can be a disservice to thin hair because taking away hair from the longest length can leave this section looking sparse and straggly. Thin and straight hair looks great if the hairdresser sticks to shallower layering as compared to spreading out the layering. Pin On Sam Villa On Youtube Hair Tutorials.</p>
