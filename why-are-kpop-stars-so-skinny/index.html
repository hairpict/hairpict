<p>So thats all I have to say about why K-POP idols are so skinny. Kpop idols have to struggle a lot to. Often on English-language KPOP entertainment sites and blogs people will comment or write about how Korean girls can be too skinny need more meat on their bones junk in the trunk etc. They cant even dream of high-calorie foods such as chicken and pizza. Why are kpop stars so skinny. Yoona Is Too Skinny Yoona Girls Generation Popular Girl.</p>
