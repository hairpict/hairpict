<p>I have a few favorites and don�t use the same. 3c hair falls under the curly hair type. For so long, curly products have targeted thick, coarse curly hair and ignored us fine haired wavies and curlies but since the curly girl method has gained popularity, more companies are coming out with product lines specifically for fine, curly and wavy hair. 3c was created and added to the hair type chart when it was clear that there was a missing type between 3b and 4a. A 3c hair is the tightest curl pattern of all type 3 hair, it looks like the curly end of a corkscrew and can be as long as a pencil or straw. Pin on natural curl puff.</p>

<p>Compared to the other type of curly hair such as 3a, 3b, and 4a, type 3c is a relatively new classification. Wavy, curly, coily, kinky and locked. Men with 3c hair type also have curly hair with closely packed strands. 3c was created and added to the hair type chart when it was clear that there was a missing type between 3b and 4a. Additionally, because the cuticle doesn’t lay as flat as type 1 or type 2 hair, the hair also isn’t as shiny. 3c/4a Low Porosity Wash and Go Tutorial by NaturallyQuinn.</p>

<p>The curls can be either kinky, or very tightly curled, with lots and lots of strands densely packed together. 3c hair is a type of curly hair characterized by tight curls with lots of voluminous strands that are perfectly packed together to enhance the texture. Men which possess this hair type, have thin curls, like wire. Additionally, because the cuticle doesn’t lay as flat as type 1 or type 2 hair, the hair also isn’t as shiny. Type 3c curly hair tests.
