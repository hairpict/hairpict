<p>Im sure the standard for losinggaining weight is different between male and female idols but ACE members have mentioned dieting quite a bit during VLiveYoutubeOther talks. A good calorie deficit would be something like 500 calories which will usually help you lose 12lbs a week. Mostly because of Genie and me wanting to dance it. The lightest female idols are Minseo and Suhyun at 34 kgThe female idols weights range from 34 kg Minseo and Suhyun to 59 kg Yunu with the average female weight being 464 kgRyujin Shin Ryujin of ITZY is quite representative of the average female K-Pop idol weight 47kg and height 165cmRyujin of ITZY - an Aries birthday 17 April 2001 Body-Mass. Ailee then shared that she lost 10 kg or 22 lbs in just a month. Pin By Petra Lim On Workout Plan Kpop Workout Kpop Diet Skinny Diet.</p>
